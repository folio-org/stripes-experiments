Stripes Core
============

This is the documentation for the `stripes-core` module, which is part of the modular UI toolkit Stripes, which is in turn part of the open library services platform [Folio](http://www.folio.org/). If you are not already familiar with Stripes, start with [The Stripes Overview](OVERVIEW.md) and [Developing Stripes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ygx38QxQiQ5RDJy5LjEz8-Y7x6sAS720VUU2T0r52-g/).

XXX to be done: stuff about stripes-core in particular.


Private notes
-------------

Try this in the "devDependencies" section of `package.json`:

        "stripes-loader": "git:../../stripes-loader"

We may find it allows us to use the local checkout of stripes-loader rather than the most recently committed version on GitHub.
