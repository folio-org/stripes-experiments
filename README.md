## Introduction

Here you will find a prototype we're using to explore how a framework to build a UI for FOLIO might look. For the moment, we're calling it "Stripes" [(here's an overview)](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/doc/overview.md). This preliminary effort is being undertaken by a small team while requirements gathering and UX design are underway.

Directories here each contain NPM modules, as things solidify they will be continue to be split into separate git repositories as has happened for much of the core functionality.

## Additional information

For more information and a quick-start guide to test it out, please see [stripes-core](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core).
