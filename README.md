## Introduction

Here you will find a prototype we're using to explore how a framework to build a UI for FOLIO might look. For the moment, we're calling it "Stripes" [(here's an overview)](stripes-core/doc/overview.md). This preliminary effort is being undertaken by a small team while requirements gathering and UX design are underway.

Directories here each contain NPM modules, as things solidify they will be split into separate git repositories.

## Additional information

For more information and a quick-start guide to test it out, please see [stripes-core](stripes-core).
